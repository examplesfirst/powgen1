`powgen1` is a ticket number generator for the USA Powerball lottery game.

The Powerball game uses two spheres with balls:

- White - with numbers from 1 to 69

The generator selects 5 numbers from the white sphere and 1 number from the red sphere.
Selected numbers can be used when filling a lottery ticket for the real game.
